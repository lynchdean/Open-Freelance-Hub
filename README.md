# Open Freelance Hub
*By Dean Lynch and David Weir*

An application to replace the middle-man from online freelance/contract work services by moving transactions onto the blockchain, providing a public, immutable ledger of past transactions to show a complete and unconcealable history of each party involved. It also gives small business and startups an alternative to hiring freelance workers, with an option to trade work with other small businesses and startups.
